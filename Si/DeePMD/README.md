# DeePMD model for Si

This is a model for calculations on solid Si. The DeePMD models
were taken from https://github.com/CSIprinceton/workshop-july-2023.git in particular from the sub-directory hands-on-sessions/day-2/4-first-model/molecular-dynamics. The input file was taken from the same 
place but modified to make the simulation time shorter.
